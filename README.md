# smart-LED-screen-connected-to-android-app
This product showcases a handcrafted wooden housing that encompasses an LED screen, constructed entirely from scratch and powered by an ESP32 microcontroller. Paired with a custom Android app developed in Kotlin, users can effortlessly control the display, featuring a real-time clock and an in-app painter with 10 preset colors for creating pixel art. Instantly see your creations come to life on the display as soon as they are made.
